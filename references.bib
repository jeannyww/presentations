abstract = {Objective
To examine the variation in prostate cancer treatment in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA)—a national, integrated delivery system. We also compared the care for older men in the VHA with that in fee-for-service Medicare.
Methods
We used data from the Veterans Affairs Central Cancer Registry linked with administrative data and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data to identify men with local or regional prostate cancer diagnosed during 2001 to 2004. We used multinomial logistic and hierarchical regression models to examine the patient, tumor, and facility characteristics associated with treatment in the VHA and, among older patients, used propensity score methods to compare primary therapy between the VHA and fee-for-service Medicare.
Results
The rates of radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy varied substantially across VHA facilities. Among the VHA patients, older age, black race/ethnicity, and greater comorbidity were associated with receiving neither radical prostatectomy nor radiotherapy. Facilities with more black patients with prostate cancer had lower rates of radical prostatectomy, and those with less availability of external beam radiotherapy had lower radiotherapy rates. The adjusted rates of radiotherapy (39.7% vs 52.0%) and radical prostatectomy (12.1% vs 15.8%) were lower and the rates of receiving neither treatment greater (48.2% vs 32.2%) in the VHA versus fee-for-service Medicare (P < .001).
Conclusions
In the VHA, the treatment rates varied substantially across facilities, and black men received less aggressive prostate cancer treatment than white men, suggesting factors other than patient preferences influence the treatment decisions. Also, primary prostate cancer therapy for older men is less aggressive in the VHA than in fee-for-service Medicare.}

	abstract = {The National Cancer Institute's ({NCI}) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results ({SEER}) registries have been a source of biospecimens for cancer research for decades. Recently, registry-based biospecimen studies have become more practical, with the expansion of electronic networks for pathology and medical record reporting. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens are now used for next-generation sequencing and other molecular techniques. These developments create new opportunities for {SEER} biospecimen research. We evaluated 31 research articles published during 2005 to 2013 based on authors' confirmation that these studies involved linkage of {SEER} data to biospecimens. Rather than providing an exhaustive review of all possible articles, our intent was to indicate the breadth of research made possible by such a resource. We also summarize responses to a 2012 questionnaire that was broadly distributed to the {NCI} intra- and extramural biospecimen research community. This included responses from 30 investigators who had used {SEER} biospecimens in their research. The survey was not intended to be a systematic sample, but instead to provide anecdotal insight on strengths, limitations, and the future of {SEER} biospecimen research. Identified strengths of this research resource include biospecimen availability, cost, and annotation of data, including demographic information, stage, and survival. Shortcomings include limited annotation of clinical attributes such as detailed chemotherapy history and recurrence, and timeliness of turnaround following biospecimen requests. A review of selected {SEER} biospecimen articles, investigator feedback, and technological advances reinforced our view that {SEER} biospecimen resources should be developed. This would advance cancer biology, etiology, and personalized therapy research.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: In 2008, we reported that radical prostatectomy, as compared with watchful waiting, reduces the rate of death from prostate cancer. After an additional 3 years of follow-up, we now report estimated 15-year results. {METHODS}: From October 1989 through February 1999, we randomly assigned 695 men with early prostate cancer to watchful waiting or radical prostatectomy. Follow-up was complete through December 2009, with histopathological review of biopsy and radical-prostatectomy specimens and blinded evaluation of causes of death. Relative risks, with 95\% confidence intervals, were estimated with the use of a Cox proportional-hazards model. {RESULTS}: During a median of 12.8 years, 166 of the 347 men in the radical-prostatectomy group and 201 of the 348 in the watchful-waiting group died (P=0.007). In the case of 55 men assigned to surgery and 81 men assigned to watchful waiting, death was due to prostate cancer. This yielded a cumulative incidence of death from prostate cancer at 15 years of 14.6\% and 20.7\%, respectively (a difference of 6.1 percentage points; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 0.2 to 12.0), and a relative risk with surgery of 0.62 (95\% {CI}, 0.44 to 0.87; P=0.01). The survival benefit was similar before and after 9 years of follow-up, was observed also among men with low-risk prostate cancer, and was confined to men younger than 65 years of age. The number needed to treat to avert one death was 15 overall and 7 for men younger than 65 years of age. Among men who underwent radical prostatectomy, those with extracapsular tumor growth had a risk of death from prostate cancer that was 7 times that of men without extracapsular tumor growth (relative risk, 6.9; 95\% {CI}, 2.6 to 18.4). {CONCLUSIONS}: Radical prostatectomy was associated with a reduction in the rate of death from prostate cancer. Men with extracapsular tumor growth may benefit from adjuvant local or systemic treatment. (Funded by the Swedish Cancer Society and the National Institutes of Health.).},

	abstract = {Racial and ethnic disparities in prostate cancer are poorly understood. A given disparity-related factor may affect outcomes differently at each point along the highly variable trajectory of the disease.To examine clinical outcomes by race and ethnicity in patients with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) within the US Veterans Health Administration.A retrospective, observational cohort study using electronic health care records (January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2021) in a nationwide equal-access health care system was conducted. Mean (SD) follow-up time was 4.3 (3.3) years. Patients included in the analysis were diagnosed with prostate cancer from January 1, 2006, to December 30, 2020, that progressed to nmCRPC defined by (1) increasing prostate-specific antigen levels, (2) ongoing androgen deprivation, and (3) no evidence of metastatic disease. Patients with metastatic disease or death within the landmark period (3 months after the first nmCRPC evidence) were excluded.The primary outcome was time from the landmark period to death or metastasis; the secondary outcome was overall survival. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, Kaplan-Meier estimates, and adjusted survival curves were used to evaluate outcome differences by race and ethnicity.Of 12 992 patients in the cohort, 826 patients identified as Hispanic (6\%), 3671 as non-Hispanic Black (28\%; henceforth Black), 7323 as non-Hispanic White (56\%; henceforth White), and 1172 of other race and ethnicity (9\%; henceforth other, including American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, unknown by patient, and patient declined to answer). Median time elapsed from nmCRPC to metastasis or death was 5.96 (95\% CI, 5.58-6.34) years for Black patients, 5.62 (95\% CI, 5.11-6.67) years for Hispanic patients, 4.11 (95\% CI, 3.96–4.25) years for White patients, and 3.59 (95\% CI, 3.23-3.97) years for other patients. Median unadjusted overall survival was 6.26 (95\% CI, 6.03-6.46) years among all patients, 8.36 (95\% CI, 8.0-8.8) years for Black patients, 8.56 (95\% CI, 7.3-9.7) years for Hispanic patients, 5.48 (95\% CI, 5.2-5.7) years for White patients, and 4.48 (95\% CI, 4.1-5.0) years for other patients.The findings of this cohort study of patients with nmCRPC suggest that differences in outcomes by race and ethnicity exist; in addition, Black and Hispanic men may have considerably improved outcomes when treated in an equal-access setting.},

Determinants of racial disparities are multifactorial, including socioeconomic and biologic factors. METHODS The authors conducted a pooled analysis of patients derived from 152 centers within the Veterans Health Administration. The cohort included men who had nonmetastatic prostate diagnosed between 2001 and 2015 and received definitive radiation therapy. The primary endpoint was prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM). Secondary endpoints included all-cause mortality (ACM) and the time from a prostate-specific antigen level ≥4 ng/mL to biopsy and radiation therapy. A Cox regression model was performed to adjust for differences between clinical parameters. RESULTS Among the 31,131 patients included in the cohort, 9584 (30.8%) were Black. The 10-year cumulative incidence of death from prostate cancer was lower in Black men compared with White men (4.0% vs 4.8%; P = .004). In a competing risk model, Black race was associated with a decreased risk of PCSM (subdistribution hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.69-0.92; P = .002). Similarly, the 10-year cumulative incidence of death from any cause was lower in Black men (27.6% vs 31.8%; P < .001). In multivariable analysis, Black men had a 10% decreased risk of ACM (hazard ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.85-0.95; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS The current results indicate relatively lower PCSM and ACM among Black men who were included in a large Veterans Health Administration cohort and received radiation therapy as primary treatment for nonmetastatic prostate cancer. There is an ongoing need to continue to understand and mitigate the factors associated with disparities in health care outcomes.},

	abstract = {Prostate cancer has the widest racial disparities of any cancer, and these disparities appear at every stage of the cancer continuum. This review focuses on the disparities in prostate cancer between Black and White men, spanning from prevention and screening to clinical outcomes. We conduct an expansive review of the literature on racial disparities in prostate cancer, interpret the findings, and discuss areas of unmet need in research. We provide an overview of epidemiologic concepts necessary to understanding the current state of prostate cancer disparities, discuss the complexities of studying race, and review potential drivers of disparities in incidence and mortality. We argue that the cause of this disparity is multifactorial and due to a combination of social and environmental factors. The path forward needs to focus on enrolling and retaining Black men in prostate cancer clinical trials and observational studies and identifying potential interventions to improve prevention and clinical outcomes in Black men.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Although many tools for the assessment of prostate cancer risk have been published, most are designed to predict only biochemical recurrence, usually after a single specified treatment. We assessed the accuracy of the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment ({CAPRA}) score, which was validated previously to predict pathological and biochemical outcomes after radical prostatectomy, to predict metastases, prostate cancer-specific mortality, and all-cause mortality. {METHODS}: We studied 10 627 men with clinically localized prostate cancer in the Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor registry, who underwent primary radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy (external beam or interstitial), androgen deprivation monotherapy, or watchful waiting/active surveillance, and had at least 6 months of follow-up after treatment. {CAPRA} scores were calculated at diagnosis from the prostate-specific antigen level, Gleason score, percentage of biopsy cores that were positive for cancer, clinical tumor stage, and age at diagnosis. Survival was studied with Kaplan-Meier analyses. Associations between increasing {CAPRA} scores and bone metastasis, cancer-specific mortality, and all-cause mortality were examined by use of proportional hazards regression, with adjustment for primary treatment; for all-cause mortality, the analysis also included adjustment for age and comorbidity. Accuracy of the {CAPRA} score was assessed with the concordance (c)-index. {RESULTS}: Among the 10 627 patients, 311 (2.9\%) men developed bone metastases, 251 (2.4\%) died of prostate cancer, and 1582 (14.9\%) died of other causes. Each single-point increase in the {CAPRA} score was associated with increased bone metastases (hazard ratio [{HR}] for bone metastases = 1.47, 95\% confidence interval [{CI}] = 1.39 to 1.56), cancer-specific mortality ({HR} for prostate cancer death = 1.39, 95\% {CI} = 1.31 to 1.48), and all-cause mortality ({HR} for death = 1.13, 95\% {CI} = 1.10 to 1.16). The {CAPRA} score was accurate for predicting metastases (c-index = 0.78), cancer-specific mortality (c-index = 0.80), and all-cause mortality (c-index = 0.71). {CONCLUSIONS}: In a large cohort of patients with clinically localized prostate cancer who were managed with one of five primary modalities, the {CAPRA} score predicted clinical prostate cancer endpoints with good accuracy. These results support the value of the {CAPRA} score as a risk assessment and stratification tool for both research studies and clinical practice.},

The {RRs} of {PSA} failure in the intermediate-risk patients (stage T2b or Gleason score of 7 or {PSA} level {\textgreater}10 and {\textless} or =20 ng/{mL}) and high-risk patients (stage T2c or {PSA} level {\textgreater}20 ng/{mL} or Gleason score {\textgreater} or =8) treated with implant compared with {RP} were 3.1 (95\% {CI}, 1.5-6.1) and 3.0 (95\% {CI}, 1.8-5.0), respectively. The addition of androgen deprivation to implant therapy did not improve {PSA} outcome in high-risk patients but resulted in a {PSA} outcome that was not statistically different compared with the results obtained using {RP} or {RT} in intermediate-risk patients. These results were unchanged when patients were stratified using the traditional rankings of biopsy Gleason scores of 2 through 4 vs 5 through 6 vs 7 vs 8 through 10. {CONCLUSIONS}: Low-risk patients had estimates of 5-year {PSA} outcome after treatment with {RP}, {RT}, or implant with or without neoadjuvant androgen deprivation that were not statistically different, whereas intermediate- and high-risk patients treated with {RP} or {RT} did better then those treated by implant. Prospective randomized trials are needed to verify these findings.},

In men with similar stages of disease, the contribution of biological vs nonbiological differences to this observed disparity is unclear. {OBJECTIVE}: To quantify the association of black race with long-term survival outcomes after controlling for known prognostic variables and access to care among men with prostate cancer. {DESIGN}, {SETTING}, {AND} {PARTICIPANTS}: This multiple-cohort study included updated individual patient-level data of men with clinical T1-4N0-1M0 prostate cancer from the following 3 cohorts: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results ({SEER} [n = 296 273]); 5 equal-access regional medical centers within the Veterans Affairs health system ({VA} [n = 3972]); and 4 pooled National Cancer Institute-sponsored Radiation Therapy Oncology Group phase 3 randomized clinical trials ({RCTs} [n = 5854]). Data were collected in the 3 cohorts from January 1, 1992, through December 31, 2013, and analyzed from April 27, 2017, through April 13, 2019. {EXPOSURES}: In the {VA} and {RCT} cohorts, all patients received surgery and radiotherapy, respectively, with curative intent. In {SEER}, radical treatment, hormone therapy, or conservative management were received. {MAIN} {OUTCOMES} {AND} {MEASURES}: Prostate cancer-specific mortality ({PCSM}).

No significant differences in {PCSM} were found in the {VA} {IPW} cohort ({sHR}, 0.85; 95\% {CI}, 0.56-1.30; P = .46), and black men had a significantly lower hazard in the {RCT} {IPW} cohort ({sHR}, 0.81; 95\% {CI}, 0.66-0.99; P = .04).

Racial differences in care are well documented; however, few studies have characterized patients based on their prostate cancer risk category, which is required to differentiate appropriate from inappropriate guideline application. {METHODS}: The medical records of a population-based sample of 777 North Carolina men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer were studied to assess the association among patient race, clinical factors, and National Comprehensive Cancer Network ({NCCN}) guideline-concordant prostate cancer care. {RESULTS}: African Americans presented with significantly higher Gleason scores (P = .025) and prostate-specific antigen levels (P = .008) than did Caucasian Americans. However, when clinical T stage was considered as well, difference in overall risk category only approached statistical significance (P = .055). Across risk categories, African Americans were less likely to have surgery (58.1\% versus 68.0\%, P = .004) and more likely to have radiation (39.0\% versus 27.4\%, P = .001) compared with Caucasian Americans. However, 83.5\% of men received guideline-concordant care within 1 year of diagnosis, which did not differ by race in multivariable analysis (odds ratio = 0.83; 95\% confidence interval = 0.54-1.25). Greater patient-perceived access to care was associated with greater odds of receiving guideline-concordant care (odds ratio = 1.06; 95\% confidence interval = 1.01-1.12). {CONCLUSIONS}: After controlling for {NCCN} risk category, there were no racial differences in receipt of guideline-concordant care.

Inclusion criteria were men 18 years and older with biopsy-confirmed prostate cancer. Men missing data on key variables (ie, cancer stage, Gleason grade group, prostate-specific antigen level, and survival follow-up data) were excluded. Analysis was performed from September 5 to December 25, 2018. {EXPOSURE}: Patient {SEER}-designated race (ie, black, white, or other). {MAIN} {OUTCOMES} {AND} {MEASURES}: Fine and Gray competing-risks regression analyses were used to evaluate the difference in prostate-cancer specific mortality between black and white men. A stratified analysis by Gleason grade group was performed stratified as grade group 1 and grade groups 2 through 5. {RESULTS}: The final cohort consisted of 229 771 men, including 178 204 white men (77.6\%), 35 006 black men (15.2\%), and 16 561 men of other or unknown race (7.2\%). Mean ({SD}) age at diagnosis was 64.9 (8.8) years. There were 4773 prostate cancer deaths among white men and 1250 prostate cancer deaths among black men. Compared with white men, black men had a higher risk of mortality overall (adjusted hazard ratio [{AHR}], 1.39 [95\% {CI}, 1.30-1.48]). In the stratified analysis, there were 4 registries in which black men had worse prostate cancer-specific survival in both Gleason grade group 1 (Atlanta, Georgia: {AHR}, 5.49 [95\% {CI}, 2.03-14.87]; Greater Georgia: {AHR}, 1.88 [95\% {CI}, 1.10-3.22]; Louisiana: {AHR}, 1.80 [95\% {CI}, 1.06-3.07]; New Jersey: {AHR}, 2.60 [95\% {CI}, 1.53-4.40]) and Gleason grade groups 2 through 5 (Atlanta: {AHR}, 1.88 [95\% {CI}, 1.46-2.45]; Greater Georgia: {AHR}, 1.29 [95\% {CI}, 1.07-1.56]; Louisiana: {AHR}, 1.28 [95\% {CI}, 1.07-1.54]; New Jersey: {AHR}, 1.52 [95\% {CI}, 1.24-1.87]), although the magnitude of survival difference was lower than for Gleason grade group 1 in each of these registries. The greatest race-based survival difference for men with Gleason grade group 1 disease was in the Atlanta registry. {CONCLUSIONS} {AND} {RELEVANCE}: These findings suggest that population-level differences in prostate cancer survival among black and white men were associated with a small set of geographic areas and with low-risk prostate cancer. Targeted interventions in these areas may help to mitigate prostate cancer care disparities at the national level.},

The evaluated outcomes were biochemical recurrence ({BCR}) and clinical recurrence ({CR}). Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to test the association between time from diagnosis to {RP} and oncological outcomes. Nonparametric curve fitting methods were used to graphically explore the relationship between time from diagnosis to {RP} and oncological outcomes. Sensitivity analyses were repeated in the subgroups of low-, intermediate-, and high-risk patients. {RESULTS}: At median follow-up of 56 months (interquartile range: 26, 92), 283 patients experienced {BCR}, and 84 patients developed {CR}. Median time from {PCa} diagnosis to surgery was 2.8 months (interquartile range: 1.6, 4.7). At multivariable Cox regression analysis, time from biopsy to {RP} was significantly associated with an increased risk of {BCR} (hazard ratio = 1.02, P = 0.0005) and {CR} (hazard ratio = 1.03, P = 0.0002). Using Nonparametric curve fitting methods, a significant increased risk of {BCR} and {CR} after approximately 18 months was observed. However, when sensitivity analyses were repeated according to risk groups, this effect was maintained in high-risk patients only, and such time interval was reduced to 12 months. {CONCLUSIONS}: Despite the overall trend on higher rate of cancer relapse after {RP}, the effect of treatment delay from biopsy to {RP} was significantly evident in high-risk patients only. Even in high-risk patients surgical treatment can be postponed safely, but not beyond the 12-month landmark.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To compare 10-year oncologic treatment outcomes of radical prostatectomy ({RP}) vs external beam radiation therapy ({EBRT}) vs brachytherapy ({BT}) for patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer ({IRPC}). {METHODS}: A retrospective analysis using propensity score matching was performed on 1503 {IRPC} patients who underwent treatment from 2004 to 2007. Eight hundred and nineteen underwent {RP}, 574 underwent {EBRT} to a median dose of 75.3 Gray, and 110 underwent {BT} using Iodine-125. Biochemical failure was defined by the American Urological Association definition of failure for {RP}, and the Phoenix definition for {EBRT} and {BT}. {RESULTS}: Median follow-up was 10.0 years for {RP}, 9.6 for {EBRT}, and 9.8 for {BT}. Neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy was given in 0.6\% of {RP}, 58.9\% of {EBRT}, and 12.7\% of {BT} patients, P {\textless}.0001. Only 14\% of {BT} received supplemental external radiation. The adjusted 10-year freedom from biochemical failure was 80.2\% for {BT} vs 57.1\% for {RP} vs 57.0\% for {EBRT}, P = .0003. Subset analysis of unfavorable {IRPC} also showed improved freedom from biochemical failure with {BT}, P {\textless}.0001. There were no significant differences in metastases-free survival or prostate cancer-specific survival after adjusting for age and Charlson comorbidity index. {CONCLUSION}: {BT} using Iodine-125, used alone or in combination with supplemental external radiation, is a reasonable treatment option for {IRPC} patients, yielding equivalent rates of metastases-free survival and prostate cancer-specific survival.},

	abstract = {Objective To evaluate the impact of length of time from diagnostic biopsy to radical prostatectomy ({RP}) on oncological outcomes amongst men diagnosed with unfavourable intermediate- to very-high-risk clinically localised prostate cancer. Patients and methods We performed a retrospective review of men with a diagnosis of grade group ({GG}) ≥3 prostate cancer on biopsy, who underwent {RP} within 6 months of diagnosis, at our institution between 2005 and 2018. We assessed patient demographics, pre-biopsy disease characteristics, and receipt of neoadjuvant therapy. We categorised time between biopsy and {RP} into two intervals: {\textless}3 and 3–6 months. For each {GG}, we compared receipt of adjuvant therapy, pathological outcomes at {RP} (positive surgical margin [{PSM}], extraprostatic extension [{EPE}], seminal vesicle invasion [{SVI}], and lymph node involvement [{LNI}]), risk of 2- and 5-year biochemical recurrence-free survival ({BCRFS}), and 2-, 5-, and 10-year metastasis-free survival ({MFS}) between patients who underwent {RP} at {\textless}3 vs 3–6 months after diagnosis. Results Amongst 2303 men who met the study inclusion criteria, 1244 (54\%) had {GG} 3, 608 (26\%) had {GG} 4, and 451 (20\%) had {GG} 5 disease. In all, 72\% underwent {RP} at {\textless}3 months after diagnosis. For each diagnostic {GG}, there was no significant difference in rates of adjuvant therapy, {PSM}, {EPE}, {SVI}, or {LNI} in men who had {RP} at {\textless}3 vs 3–6 months after diagnosis. In all, 1568 men had follow-up after {RP} of {\textgreater}1 year. For each diagnostic {GG}, there was no significant difference in 2- and 5-year {BCRFS} between patients who had {RP} at {\textless}3 vs 3–6 months after diagnosis ({GG} 3: 78\% vs 83\% and 69\% vs 66\%, respectively, P = 0.6; {GG} 4: 68\% vs 74\% and 51\% vs 57\%, respectively, P = 0.4; {GG} 5: 58\% vs 74\% and 48\% vs 54\%, respectively, P = 0.2). Similarly, for each diagnostic {GG}, there was no significant difference in 2-, 5-, and 10-year {MFS} between patients who had {RP} at {\textless}3 vs 3–6 months after diagnosis, although we were not able to calculate 10-year {MFS} for patients with {GG} 5 disease due to limited follow-up in that group ({GG} 3: 98\%, 92\%, and 84\% vs 97\%, 95\%, and 91\%, respectively, P = 0.4; {GG} 4: 97\%, 90\%, and 72\% vs 94\%, 91\%, and 81\%, respectively, P = 0.8; {GG} 5: 89\% and 81\% vs 91\% and 71\%, respectively, P = 0.9).

Understanding how and why patients make their treatment decisions, as well as the effect of treatment choice on long-term outcomes, is critical to ensuring effective, patient-centered care. This study examined treatment decision-making in a racially diverse, equal-access, contemporary cohort of patients with {PCa} counseled on treatment options at a multidisciplinary clinic. {METHODS}: A prospective cohort study was initiated at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (formerly Walter Reed Army Medical Center) in 2006. Newly diagnosed patients with {PCa} were enrolled before attending a multidisciplinary clinic. Patients completed surveys preclinic and postclinic to assess treatment preferences, reasons for treatment choice, and decisional regret. {RESULTS}: As of January 2014, 925 patients with {PCa} enrolled in this study. Surgery (54\%), external radiation (20\%), and active surveillance (12\%) were the most common primary treatments for patients with low- and intermediate-risk {PCa}, whereas patients with high-risk {PCa} chose surgery (34\%) or external radiation with neoadjuvant hormones (57\%). Treatment choice differed by age at diagnosis, race, comorbidity status, and calendar year in both univariable and multivariable analyses. Patients preferred to play an active role in the decision-making process and cited doctors at the clinic as the most helpful source of treatment-related information. Almost all patients reported satisfaction with their decision. {CONCLUSIONS}: This is one of the first prospective cohort studies to examine treatment decision-making in an equal-access, multidisciplinary clinic setting.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Long-term population-based cohort studies of men diagnosed with prostate cancer are limited. However, adverse outcomes can occur many years after treatment. Herein, we aim to assess the utility of using claims data to identify prostate cancer progression 10-15 years after diagnosis. {METHODS}: The study population was derived from the North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project ({PCaP}). {PCaP}-North Carolina ({NC}) included 1031 men diagnosed with prostate cancer from 2004 to 2009. An initial follow-up with a survey and manual medical record abstraction occurred from 2008 to 2011 (Follow-up 1). Herein, we extended this follow-up with linkage to healthcare claims data from North Carolina (2011-2017) and a second, supplementary 10-year follow-up survey (2018-2020) (Follow-up 2). Vital statistics data also were utilized. Long-term oncological progression was determined using these data sources in combination with expert clinical input. {RESULTS}: Among the 1031 baseline {PCaP}-{NC} participants, 652 were linked to medical claims. Forty-two percent of the men had insurance coverage for the entire 72 months of follow-up. In addition, 275 baseline participants completed the supplementary 10-year follow-up survey. Using all sources of follow-up data, we identified a progression event in 259 of 1031 (25\%) men with more than 10 years of follow-up data after diagnosis. {CONCLUSIONS}: Understanding long-term clinical outcomes is essential for improving the lives of prostate cancer survivors. However, access and utility of long-term clinical outcomes with claims alone remain a challenge due to individualized agreements required with each insurer for data access, lack of detailed clinical information, and gaps in insurance coverage. We were able to utilize claims data to determine long-term progression due to several unique advantages that included the availability of detailed baseline clinical characteristics and treatments, detailed manually abstracted clinical data at 5 years of follow-up, vital statistics data, and a supplementary 10-year follow-up survey.},

	abstract = {Context Prostate cancer ({PCa}) is a complex disease that disproportionately impacts Black men in the {USA}. The structural factors that drive heterogeneous outcomes for patients of differing backgrounds are probably the same ones that result in population-level disparities. The relative contribution of drivers along the {PCa} disease continuum is an active area of investigation and debate. Objective To critically synthesize the available evidence on {PCa} disparities from a population-level perspective in comparison to data from “equal access and equal care settings” and to provide a consensus summary of the state of {PCa} disparities. Evidence acquisition A plenary panel on {PCa} disparities presented at the Prostate Cancer Foundation meeting on October 24, 2019 and ensuing discussions are reported here. We used a systematic literature review approach and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses to select the most relevant publications. A total of 3333 publications between 2011 and 2021 were retrieved, of which 52 were included in the review; an additional 13 articles on screening guidelines, seminal clinical trials, and statistical methodology were used in the evidence synthesis. Evidence synthesis Race disparities in {PCa} are a result of a complex interaction between socioeconomic factors impacting access to care and ancestral/genetic factors that may influence tumor biology. Black men in the {USA} continue to have a nearly 1.8 times higher population-level incidence rate than White men. Failure to account for the race-specific incidence burden would continue to lead to residual disparity even after achieving relatively similar outcomes after primary treatment, resulting in a higher long-term mortality burden. Selection bias remains possible in {PCa} studies, which often rely on highly specific cohorts of Black men with higher use of health care resources that may not represent the average Black patient in the {USA}. Novel methods including mediation analysis and genetic ancestry rather than self-identified race can optimize analytical models investigating racial disparities and may lead to a better understanding of {PCa} genomic diversity and behavior. Conclusions Our findings emphasize the importance of racially diverse studies, including precision -omics, prevention, and targeted therapy initiatives, to elucidate mechanisms underlying racial differences in outcomes and response to therapy. We propose novel approaches for studying and addressing {PCa} disparities. Contemporary methods, particularly in the domain of mediation analysis, can promote scientific rigor in understanding these disparities. Patient summary Inaccurate data interpretation or lack of data altogether for Black men can impact policy and ultimately affect millions of individuals of African origin worldwide. Our review identifies a need to develop and prioritize a strategy for including Black and other men with prostate cancer in intervention studies and randomized clinical trials to halt the widening prostate cancer disparities.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: African American prostate cancer survivors experience post-treatment decisional regret more often than European Americans, which can lead to negative long-term effects on quality of life. A prominent driver of health-related decision-making is emotion, yet little work has examined the impact emotions may have on decisional regret. The goal of this study was to explore experiences, perceptions, and emotions of prostate cancer survivors in relation to their diagnostic and treatment decision-making processes, prostate cancer treatment, and outcomes. Additionally, we sought to identify factors that might explain differences in prostate cancer outcomes between African and European Americans. {DESIGN}: This mixed-methods study utilized a convergent parallel design, in which quantitative and qualitative data were collected simultaneously and then integrated to more robustly explain relationships between variables. Survivors were eligible for the study if they had been previously diagnosed with localized prostate cancer and were no more than six months post-treatment. The study was guided by the Risk as Feelings Model, which predicts the relationship between emotion and cognition in high-risk decision-making. {RESULTS}: No men experienced decisional regret following treatment, even if they experienced side effects. While all men reported being surprised about their prostate cancer diagnosis, strong negative emotions were more common among men under 65. Family support and spirituality appeared to mitigate negative emotions. Perceived authenticity of provider communication was the most influential mediator in men's decision-making and positive perceptions of their outcomes. {CONCLUSIONS}: To mitigate the impact emotional responses have on decision-making and post-treatment regret, providers should explore alternate therapies (e.g. counseling for men diagnosed with prostate cancer at a young age) and include family members in prostate cancer treatment discussions. Most importantly, providers should be aware of the importance of quality communication on men's cognitive and emotional processes and their perceptions of treatment outcomes.},

Whether this difference is driven by biological versus sociodemographic and access to care differences is actively investigated. However, studies that have highlighted racial disparities in {PCa} outcomes have been poorly represented by elderly men, a notoriously undertreated group. Herein, we evaluated use of curative treatment between Black and White elderly men with aggressive {PCa} in a large {US} database. {METHODS}: Men ≥80 years diagnosed with National Comprehensive Cancer Network-defined high risk {PCa} between 2004 and 2016 were analyzed from the National Cancer Database. Multivariable logistic regression was used to model the effect of race and sociodemographic factors on receipt of definitive therapy (surgery or radiation +/- androgen deprivation therapy [{ADT}]) versus non-definitive therapy ({ADT} alone or observation) in inverse probability weighted groups matched for stage, prostate-specific antigen, and Gleason score. {RESULTS}: Between 2004 and 2016, utilization of definitive therapy with either surgery or radiation therapy increased in both White and Black men in the United States. However, we found that Black men compared with White men were significantly less likely to receive definitive therapy ({OR} 0.71, 95\% {CI} 0.64-0.79, p {\textless} .001). Using multivariable modeling, effect size diminished after adjusting for sociodemographic variables. Notably, there is evidence of the racial disparity narrowing over time. {CONCLUSIONS}: These findings highlight striking but improving racial disparities in elderly men with high risk {PCa} in the {US}, an overall undertreated population.},

	abstract = {Objective To examine socioeconomic and clinical factors that may predict a longer interval between prostate biopsy and radical prostatectomy ({RP}). Methods The Columbia University Urologic Oncology Database was queried for patients who underwent {RP} from 1990-2010. Time to surgery ({TTS}) was defined as the period between the most recent positive prostate biopsy and date of surgery. Clinical factors examined included: age, D'Amico risk group, year of surgery, body mass index, and comorbidities. Socioeconomic factors included race/ethnicity, relationship status, income, and distance to treatment center. The relationship between clinical/socioeconomic factors and {TTS} was evaluated using univariate and multivariate regression models. Results Two-thousand five-hundred seventy-three patients were included in the analysis. Median {TTS} was 48 days ({IQR} 35-70, range 43-1103), and 71\% of patients underwent {RP} within 60 days after the most recent positive biopsy. On multivariate analysis, living further from the medical center was associated with shorter {TTS} (P = .01), whereas more recent year of surgery (P = .01), comorbid cardiovascular disease (P = .007), African-American (P = .005) or Hispanic race (P = .005), divorced relationship status (P = .01), and lower income (P = .003) were all associated with longer {TTS}. Conclusion Patients often experience widely variable intervals between the diagnosis and treatment of localized prostate cancer. Longer intervals before surgery may point to disparities in access to prostate cancer care, and not increased decision-making time by the patient.},

	abstract = {Objectives. The authors examine the data quality and measurement performance of the Primary Care Assessment Survey ({PCAS}), a patient-completed questionnaire that operationalizes formal definitions of primary care, including the definition recently proposed by the Institute of Medicine Committee on the Future of Primary Care. Methods. The {PCAS} measures seven domains of care through 11 summary scales: accessibility (organizational, financial), continuity (longitudinal, visit-based), comprehensiveness (contextual knowledge of patient, preventive counseling), integration, clinical interaction (clinician-patient communication, thoroughness of physical examinations), interpersonal treatment, and trust. Data from a study of Massachusetts state employees (n = 6094) were used to evaluate key measurement properties of the 11 {PCAS} scales. Analyses were performed on the combined population and for each of the 16 subgroups defined according to sociode-mographic and health characteristics. Results. The 11 {PCAS} scales demonstrated consistently strong measurement characteristics across all subgroups of this adult population. Tests of scaling assumptions for summated rating scales were well satisfied by all Likert-scaled measures. Assessment of data completeness, scale score dispersion characteristics, and inter-scale correlations provide strong evidence for the soundness of all scales, and for the value of separately measuring and interpreting these concepts. Conclusions. With public and private sector policies increasingly emphasizing the importance of primary care, the need for tools to evaluate and improve primary care performance is clear. The {PCAS} has excellent measurement properties, and performs consistently well across varied segments of the adult population. Widespread application of an assessment methodology, such as the {PCAS}, will afford an empiric basis through which to measusre, monitor, and continuously improve primary care.},

Incidence data (through 2017) were collected by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program; the National Program of Cancer Registries; and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Mortality data (through 2018) were collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2021, 1,898,160 new cancer cases and 608,570 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States. After increasing for most of the 20th century, the cancer death rate has fallen continuously from its peak in 1991 through 2018, for a total decline of 31\%, because of reductions in smoking and improvements in early detection and treatment. This translates to 3.2 million fewer cancer deaths than would have occurred if peak rates had persisted. Long-term declines in mortality for the 4 leading cancers have halted for prostate cancer and slowed for breast and colorectal cancers, but accelerated for lung cancer, which accounted for almost one-half of the total mortality decline from 2014 to 2018. The pace of the annual decline in lung cancer mortality doubled from 3.1\% during 2009 through 2013 to 5.5\% during 2014 through 2018 in men, from 1.8\% to 4.4\% in women, and from 2.4\% to 5\% overall. This trend coincides with steady declines in incidence (2.2\%-2.3\%) but rapid gains in survival specifically for nonsmall cell lung cancer ({NSCLC}). For example, {NSCLC} 2-year relative survival increased from 34\% for persons diagnosed during 2009 through 2010 to 42\% during 2015 through 2016, including absolute increases of 5\% to 6\% for every stage of diagnosis; survival for small cell lung cancer remained at 14\% to 15\%. Improved treatment accelerated progress against lung cancer and drove a record drop in overall cancer mortality, despite slowing momentum for other common cancers.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Robotic surgery has been widely adopted for radical prostatectomy. We hypothesized that this change is rapidly shifting procedures away from hospitals that do not offer robotics and consequently increasing patient travel. {METHODS}: A population-based observational study of all prostatectomies for cancer in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania from 2000 to 2009 was performed using hospital discharge data. Hospital procedure volume was defined as the number of prostatectomies performed for cancer in a given year. Straight-line travel distance to the treating hospital was calculated for each case. Hospitals were contacted to determine the year of acquisition of the first robot. {RESULTS}: From 2000 to 2009, the total number of prostatectomies performed annually increased substantially. The increase occurred almost entirely at the very high-volume centers ({\textgreater}/= 106 prostatectomies/year). The number of hospitals performing prostatectomy fell 37\% from 2000 to 2009. By 2009, the 9\% (21/244) of hospitals that had very high volume performed 57\% of all prostatectomies, and the 35\% (86/244) of hospitals with a robot performed 85\% of all prostatectomies. The median travel distance increased 54\% from 2000 to 2009 (P{\textless}.001). The proportion of patients traveling {\textgreater}/= 15 miles increased from 24\% to 40\% (P {\textless} .001). {CONCLUSIONS}: Over the past decade, the number of radical prostatectomies performed has risen substantially. These procedures have been increasingly centralized at high-volume centers, leading to longer patient travel distances. Few prostatectomies are now performed at hospitals that do not offer robotic surgery.},

	abstract = {The incidence and mortality rates of prostate cancer are significantly higher in African-American men when compared with European-American men. We tested the hypothesis that differences in tumor biology contribute to this survival health disparity. Using microarray technology, we obtained gene expression profiles of primary prostate tumors resected from 33 African-American and 36 European-American patients. These tumors were matched on clinical variables. We also evaluated 18 nontumor prostate tissues from seven African-American and 11 European-American patients. The resulting datasets were analyzed for expression differences on the gene and pathway level comparing African-American with European-American patients. Our analysis revealed a significant number of genes, e.g., 162 transcripts at a false-discovery rate of {\textless}or=5\% to be differently expressed between African-American and European-American patients. Using a disease association analysis, we identified a common relationship of these transcripts with autoimmunity and inflammation. These findings were corroborated on the pathway level with numerous differently expressed genes clustering in immune response, stress response, cytokine signaling, and chemotaxis pathways. Several known metastasis-promoting genes, including autocrine mobility factor receptor, chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4, and matrix metalloproteinase 9, were more highly expressed in tumors from African-Americans than European-Americans. Furthermore, a two-gene tumor signature that accurately differentiated between African-American and European-American patients was identified. This finding was confirmed in a blinded analysis of a second sample set. In conclusion, the gene expression profiles of prostate tumors indicate prominent differences in tumor immunobiology between African-American and European-American men. The profiles portray the existence of a distinct tumor microenvironment in these two patient groups.},

	abstract = {A new sampling approach for case-control studies offers a flexible alternative to frequency matching. In the "randomized recruitment" method, subjects are individually randomized to be recruited or not on the basis of investigator-imposed recruitment probabilities that can depend on both disease status and values of covariates already available or ascertained in a screening interview. When there is prior information about the odds ratios associated with the screening variables, such a design can achieve "probability matching," without the well-known disadvantages that encumber traditional matching. The method can also be used to enlarge the relative size of subsamples of interest. Following randomized recruitment, a modified logistic regression analysis allows unbiased estimation of effects associated with all variables studied, including the "matching" variables. One can also readily fit an additive model. The method is illustrated by developing the recruitment probabilities required for probability matching on age, sex, and cigarette smoking status in an ongoing study of lung cancer and exposure to radon progeny in which smoking cases are undersampled.},

	abstract = {{IMPORTANCE}: There is a lack of data evaluating the association of surgical delay time ({SDT}) with outcomes in patients with localized, high-risk prostate cancer. {OBJECTIVE}: To investigate the association of {SDT} of radical prostatectomy and final pathological and survival outcomes. {DESIGN}, {SETTING}, {AND} {PARTICIPANTS}: This cohort study used data from the {US} National Cancer Database ({NCDB}) and identified all patients with clinically localized ({cT}1-2cN0cM0) high-risk prostate adenocarcinoma diagnosed between 2006 and 2016 who underwent radical prostatectomy. Data analyses were performed from April 1 to April 12, 2020. {EXPOSURES}: {SDT} was defined as the number of days between the initial cancer diagnosis and radical prostatectomy. {SDT} was categorized into 5 groups: 31 to 60, 61 to 90, 91 to 120, 121 to 150, and 151 to 180 days. {MAIN} {OUTCOMES} {AND} {MEASURES}: The primary outcomes were predetermined as adverse pathological outcomes after radical prostatectomy, including {pT}3-T4 disease, {pN}-positive disease, and positive surgical margin. The adverse pathological score ({APS}) was defined as an accumulated score of the 3 outcomes (0-3). An {APS} of 2 or higher was considered a separate outcome to capture cases with more aggressive pathological features. The secondary outcome was overall survival. {RESULTS}: Of the 32 184 patients included in the study, the median (interquartile range) age was 64 (59-68) years, and 25 548 (79.4\%) were non-Hispanic White. Compared with an {SDT} of 31 to 60 days, longer {SDTs} were not associated with higher risks of having any adverse pathological outcomes (odds ratio [{OR}], 0.95; 95\% {CI}, 0.80-1.12; P = .53), {pT}3-T4 disease ({OR}, 0.99; 95\% {CI}, 0.83-1.17; P = .87), {pN}-positive disease ({OR}, 0.79; 95\% {CI}, 0.59-1.06; P = .12), positive surgical margin ({OR}, 0.88; 95\% {CI}, 0.74-1.05; P = .17), or {APS} greater than or equal to 2 ({OR}, 0.90; 95\% {CI}, 0.74-1.05; P = .17). Longer {SDT} was also not associated with worse overall survival (for {SDT} of 151-180 days, hazard ratio, 1.12; 95\% {CI}, 0.79-1.59, P = .53). Subgroup analyses performed for patients with very high-risk disease (primary Gleason score 5) and sensitivity analyses with {SDT} considered as a continuous variable yielded similar results. {CONCLUSIONS} {AND} {RELEVANCE}: In this cohort study of patients who underwent radical prostatectomy within 180 days of diagnosis for high-risk prostate cancer, radical prostatectomy for high-risk prostate cancer could be safely delayed up to 6 months after diagnosis.},

However, such somatic aberration and its association with prognostic factors have neither been studied in a West African population nor been systematically reviewed in the context of racial differences. We used immunohistochemistry to assess oncoprotein encoded by the {ERG} gene as the established surrogate of {ERG} fusion genes among 262 prostate cancer biopsies from the Ghana Prostate Study (2004-2006). Poisson regression with robust variance estimation provided prevalence ratios and 95\% confidence intervals of {ERG} expression in relation to patient characteristics. We found that 47 of 262 (18\%) prostate cancers were {ERG}-positive, and being negative for {ERG} staining was associated with higher Gleason score. We further conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of {TMPRSS}2:{ERG} fusions in relation to race, Gleason score, and tumor stage, combining results from Ghana with 40 additional studies. Meta-analysis showed the prevalence of {TMPRSS}2:{ERG} fusions in prostate cancer to be highest in men of European descent (49\%), followed by men of Asian (27\%) and then African (25\%) descent. The lower prevalence of {TMPRSS}2:{ERG} fusions in men of African descent implies that alternative genomic mechanisms might explain the disproportionately high prostate cancer burden in such populations.},

	abstract = {Currently, the standard management for locally advanced prostate cancer ({PCa}) is still controversial. In our study, we aimed to compare the survival outcomes of radical prostatectomy ({RP}) versus external beam radiotherapy ({EBRT}).We conducted analyses with a large cohort of 38,544 patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results ({SEER}) database (2004-2016). Propensity score matching, Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox proportional hazard regression were used to reduce the influence of bias and compare the overall survival ({OS}) and cancer specific survival ({CSS}). Several different sensitivity analyses including inverse probability of treatment weighting and standardized mortality ratio weighting were used to verify the robustness of the results.Totally, 33,388 men received {RP} and 5,156 men received {EBRT} with {cT}3-4N0M0 {PCa} were included in this study. According to the Kaplan-Meier curves, {RP} performed better in both {OS} and {CSS} compared with {EBRT} (P {\textless} .0001). In the adjusted multivariate Cox regression, {RP} also showed better {OS} and {CSS} benefits ({OS}: {HR}=0.50; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}]: 0.46-0.54; P {\textless} .0001 and {CSS}: {HR}=0.43; 95\% {CI}: 0.38-0.49; P {\textless} .0001).
